# Explicit [[Parallelism]]

Explicit parallelism refers to the use of duplicated hardware components within a [[CPU]], computer or computer system, for the purpose of running more than one instruction stream simultaneously. In other words, explicitly parallel hardware is designed to run concurrent software more efficiently than would be possible on a serial computing platform. 

The most common examples of explicit parallelism are:
- hyperthreaded CPUs,
- multicore CPUs,
- multiprocessor computers,
- computer clusters,
- grid computing,
- cloud computing.
