# Orthogonality of [[Concurrency]] and [[Parallelism]]

We should stress here that concurrent software doesn’t *require* parallel hardware, and parallel hardware isn’t *only* for running concurrent software. For example, a concurrent multithreaded program can run on a single, serial CPU core via [[Preemptive Multitasking|preemptive multitasking]]. Likewise, [[Implicit Parallelism|instruction level parallelism]] is intended to improve the performance of a single thread, and therefore benefits both concurrent and sequential software. So while they are closely related, concurrency and parallelism are really orthogonal concepts.

As long as our system involves multiple readers and/or multiple writers of a shared data object, we have a concurrent system. Concurrency can be achieved via preemptive multitasking (on serial or parallel hardware) or via true parallelism (in which each thread executes on a distinct core)—the techniques we’ll learn in this chapter will be applicable either way.
