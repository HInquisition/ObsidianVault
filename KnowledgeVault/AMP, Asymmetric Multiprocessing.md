# AMP, Asymmetric multiprocessing

In <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP)</mark>, the CPU cores are not necessarily homogeneous, and the operating system does not treat them equally. In AMP, one “master” CPU core typically runs the operating system, and the other cores are treated as “slaves” to which workloads are distributed by the master core.
