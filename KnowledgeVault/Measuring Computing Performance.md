# Measuring Computing Performance

Computing performance typically measured in millions of instructions
per second (MIPS) or floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)

In the late 1970s, the Intel 8087 floating-point coprocessor could
muster only about 50 kFLOPS ($5 * 10^4$ FLOPS), while at roughly the same
time a Cray-1 supercomputer the size of a large refrigerator could operate at a
rate of roughly 160 MFLOPS ($1.6 * 10^8$ FLOPS). 
Today, the CPU in game consoles like the Playstation 4 or the Xbox One produces roughly 100 GFLOPS ($10^{11}$ FLOPS)
