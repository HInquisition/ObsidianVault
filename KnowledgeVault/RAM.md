# RAM, Random Access [[Memory]]
Ram - fast read/write memory

- RAM retain their data as long as power is applied to them

RAM can be further divided into static RAM ([[SRAM]]) and dynamic RAM
([[DRAM]]). But unlike static RAM, dynamic RAM needs to be
“refreshed” periodically (by reading the data and then re-writing it) in order to
prevent its contents from disappearing. This is because [[DRAM]] memory cells
are built from MOS capacitors that gradually lose their charge, and reading
such memory cells is destructive to the data they contain.

RAM can also be categorized by various other design characteristics, such
as:
• whether it is multi-ported, meaning that it be accessed simultaneously by
more than one component within the [[CPU|CPU]];
• whether it operates by being synchronized to a clock ([[SDRAM]]) or asynchronously;
• and whether or not it supports double data rate access ([[DDR]]), meaning
the RAM can be read or written on both rising and falling clock
