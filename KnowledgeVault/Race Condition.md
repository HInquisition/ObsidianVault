# Race Conditions

A <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">race condition</mark> is defined as any situation in which the behavior of a program is dependent on timing. In other words, in the presence of a race condition, the behavior of the program can change when the relative sequence of events occurring across the system changes, due to variability in the lengths of time taken by the various flows of control to perform their tasks.
