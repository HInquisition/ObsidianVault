# ROM, Read - only [[Memory]]
It is the primary memory unit of a computer along with the random access memory ([[RAM]]). It is called read only memory as we can only read the programs and data stored on it but cannot write on it. 

- ROM modules retain their data even when power is not applied to them.

The manufacturer of ROM fills the programs into the ROM at the time of manufacturing the ROM. After this, the content of the ROM can't be altered, which means you can't reprogram, rewrite, or erase its content later. However, there are some types of ROM where you can modify the data, they known as electronically erasable programmable ROM or [[EEPROM]], and they can be reprogrammed over and over again. (Flash drives are one example of [[EEPROM]] memory.)

A simple example of ROM is the cartridge used in video game consoles that allows the system to run many games. The data which is stored permanently on personal computers and other electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, TV, AC, etc. is also an example of ROM.

For example, when you start your computer, the screen does not appear instantly. It takes time to appear as there are startup instructions stored in ROM which are required to start the computer during the booting process. The work of the booting process is to start the computer. It loads the operating system into the main memory ([[RAM]]) installed on your computer. The [[BIOS]] program, which is also present in the computer memory (ROM) is used by the microprocessor of the computer to start the computer during the booting process. It allows you to open the computer and connects the computer with the operating system.

ROM is also used to store [[Firmware]], which is a software program which remains attached to the hardware or programmed on a hardware device like a keyboard, hard drive, video cards, etc. It is stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device. It provides instructions to the device to communicate and interact with other devices.
