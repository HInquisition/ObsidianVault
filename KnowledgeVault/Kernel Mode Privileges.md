# Kernel Mode Privileges

[[Kernel Mode versus User Mode|Kernel mode]] (ring 0) software has access to all of the [[Machine Language|machine language]] instructions defined by the CPU’s [[ISA, Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]]. This includes a powerful subset of instructions called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">privileged instructions</mark>. These privileged instructions might allow certain registers to be modified that are normally off-limits (e.g., to control [[Memory Architecture#Virtual Memory Mapping|virtual memory mapping]], or to mask and unmask interrupts). Or they might allow certain regions of memory to be accessed, or allow other normally restricted operations to be performed. Examples of privileged instructions on the Intel x86 processor include `wrmsr` (write to model-specific register) and `cli` (clear interrupts). By restricting the use of these powerful instructions only to “trusted” software like the kernel, system stability and security is improved.

With these privileged ML instructions, the kernel can implement security measures. For example, the kernel typically locks down certain pages of [[Virtual Memory|virtual memory]] so that they cannot be written to by a user program. Both the kernel’s software and all of its internal record-keeping data are kept in protected [[Virtual Memory#Virtual Memory Pages|memory pages]]. This ensures that a user program won’t stomp on the kernel, and thereby crash the entire system.
