# Why Write Concurrent Software?

Concurrent programs are sometimes written because a model of multiple semi-independent flows of control simply matches the problem better than a single flow-of-control design. A concurrent design might also be chosen to best make use of a multicore computing platform, even if the problem at hand might be more naturally suited to a sequential design.
