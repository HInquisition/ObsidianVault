# Kernel Mode versus User Mode

[[The Kernel]] and its device drives run in a special mode called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">protected mode</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">privileged mode</mark> or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">kernel mode</mark>, while all other programs in the system (including all other parts of the operating system that aren’t part of the kernel) operate in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">user mode</mark>. As the name suggests, software running in privileged mode has full access to all of the hardware in the computer, whereas user mode software is restricted in various ways in order to ensure stability of the computer system as a whole. Software running in user mode can access low-level services only by making a special <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">kernel call</mark>—a request for the kernel to perform a low-level operation on the user program’s behalf. This ensures that a program can’t inadvertently or maliciously destabilize the system.

In practice, operating systems may implement multiple <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">protection rings</mark>. The kernel runs in ring 0, which is the most trusted ring and has all possible privileges within the system. Device drivers might run in ring 1, trusted programs with I/O permissions might run in ring 2, while all other “untrusted” user programs run in ring 3. But this is just one example—the number of rings varies from CPU to CPU and from OS to OS, as does the assignment of subsystems to the various rings.
