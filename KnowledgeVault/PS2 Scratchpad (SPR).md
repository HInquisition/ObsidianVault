# PS2 Scratchpad (SPR)

The main [[CPU]] on the PS2, called the **emotion engine (EE)**, has a special 16 KiB area of memory called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">the scratchpad</mark> (abbreviated <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">SPR</mark>), in addition to a 16 KiB L1 instruction cache ([[I-cache]]) and an 8 KiB L1 data cache ([[D-cache]]). The PS2 also contains two vector coprocessors known as VU0 and VU1, each with their own L1 I- and D-caches, and a [[GPU]] known as the **graphics synthesizer** (GS) connected to a 4 MiB bank of video RAM.

**The scratchpad** is located on the CPU die, and therefore enjoys the same low latency as [[Memory Cache#Memory Cache Hierarchies|L1 cache]] memory. But unlike the L1 cache, the scratchpad is [[Memory Architecture#Memory Mapping|memory-mapped]] so that it appears to the programmer to be a range of regular main [[RAM]] addresses. The scratchpad on the PS2 is itself uncached, meaning that reads and writes from and to it are direct; they bypass the EE’s L1 cache entirely.

The scratchpad’s main benefit isn’t actually its low access latency—it’s the fact that the CPU can access scratchpad memory without making use of the [[System bus|system buses]]. As such, reads and writes from and to the scratchpad can happen while the system’s address and data bus are being used for other purposes. For example, a game might set up a chain of [[DMA]] requests to transfer data between main RAM and the two [[Vector processing unit, VPU|vector processing units (VUs)]] in the PS2. While these DMAs are being processed by the [[DMAC]], and/or while the VUs are busy performing calculations (both of which would make heavy use of the system buses), the EE can be performing calculations on data that resides within the scratchpad, without interfering with the DMAs or the operation of the VUs. Moving data into and out of the scratchpad can be done via regular memory move instructions (or `memcpy()` in C/C++), but this task can also be accomplished via [[DMA]] requests. The PS2’s scratchpad therefore gives the programmer a lot of flexibility and power in order to maximize a game engine’s data throughput.
