# Implicit versus Explicit [[Parallelism]]

One way to classify the various forms of parallelism in computer hardware design is to consider the purpose of parallelism in each. In other words, what problem does parallelism solve in a given design? 

Thinking along these lines, we can divide parallelism coarsely into two categories:
• [[Implicit Parallelism]]
• [[Explicit Parallelism]]

![[Implicit Parallelism#Implicit Parallelism]]

![[Explicit Parallelism#Explicit Parallelism]]
