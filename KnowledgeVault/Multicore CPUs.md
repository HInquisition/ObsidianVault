# Multicore CPUs

A CPU core can be defined as a self-contained unit capable of executing instructions from at least one instruction stream. Every CPU design we’ve looked at until now could therefore qualify as a “core.” When more than one core is included on a single CPU die, we call it a multicore CPU.

The specific design within each core can be any of the designs we’ve looked at thus far—each core might employ a simple serial design, a [[Pipelined CPU|pipelined design]], a [[Superscalar CPU|superscalar architecture]], a [[VLIW]] design, or might be a [[Hyperthreading|hyperthreaded core]].
