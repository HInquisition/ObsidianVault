# [[Registers|Register]] Files

The set of [[Registers]] in the [[CPU]] is called a **register file**.

A [[CPU]]’s register file is perhaps the most extreme example of a memory architecture designed to minimize access latency. Registers are typically implemented using multi-ported static RAM ([[SRAM]]), usually with dedicated ports for read and write operations, allowing these operations to occur in parallel rather than serially. What’s more, the register file is typically located immediately adjacent to the circuitry for the [[ALU]] that uses it. Furthermore, registers are accessed pretty much directly by the [[ALU]], whereas accesses to main [[RAM]] typically have to pass through the virtual address translation system (see [[Virtual Memory]]), the memory cache hierarchy and cache coherence protocol (see [[Memory Cache]]), the address and data [[Bus|buses]], and possibly also through crossbar switching logic. These facts explain why registers can be accessed so quickly, and also why the cost of register [[RAM]] is relatively high as compared to general-purpose RAM. This higher cost is justified because [[Registers]] are by far the most frequently used memory in any computer, and because the total size of the register file is very small when compared to the size of main RAM.
